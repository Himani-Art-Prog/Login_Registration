Authentication - Who Are You?

Authentication mechanisms include:
1) Usernames and passwords
2) Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition)
3) Multi-factor authentication (combining two or more authentication methods)
4) Single sign-on (SSO) systems
5) OAuth, OpenID Connect, and other identity federation protocols

Authorization - What can you do?

Authorization mechanisms include:
1) Role-based access control (RBAC): Users are assigned roles, and each role is granted specific permissions.
2) Attribute-based access control (ABAC): Access decisions are based on attributes associated with the user, the resource, and the environment.
3) Policy-based access control: Access control policies define rules that specify who can access what resources under what conditions.
4) Claims-based access control: Access decisions are based on claims or assertions made about the user.
